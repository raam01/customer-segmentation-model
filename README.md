# Customer segmentation model

This repository consists of the customer segmentation model done for an retail company. The customers were split into clusters based on 

1. Recency
2. Frequency
3. Monetary value

and combined back to form 3 clusters. This kind of clustering is helpful in grouping customers and targetting a segment to increase revenue & growth.
